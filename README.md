# Task 1 : Virtual Machine Setup & RISC-V Code Execution
# Overview

This task contains a simple C program for calculating the sum of n integers, along with its compiled output and the equivalent RISC-V assembly code. The entire setup was performed on an Ubuntu-based Virtual Machine (VM) created using VirtualBox.

# Task 2: RISC-V O1 and Ofast Optimization Analysis
# Overview

This task involves a simple C program for swapping two numbers, along with its compiled output and the corresponding RISC-V assembly code. Additionally, the program is executed using the GCC compiler with O1 and Ofast optimization levels. Furthermore, a register-level analysis is conducted using Spike, providing insights into the impact of these optimizations on execution performance.
